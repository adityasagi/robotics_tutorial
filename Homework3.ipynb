    "1) Implement the forward kinematics for a spatial-3R robot shown below. The lengths of the links L1, L2 and L3 are all 1m. The first revolute joint rotates about an axis that is vertical in the plane of the page. The second and third revolute joints rotate about axes that are normal to the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Design a neural network to solve the inverse kinematics for the spatial 3R robot. Generate data to train the neural network using the forward kinematics function. Use the test data to verify the output of the trained network. Ensure that the error is less than 0.1 degrees for each joint angle. Test the data on atleast 5 random points in the workspace of the robot. Generate the training graph."
