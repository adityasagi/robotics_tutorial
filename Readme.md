## Setup

To install Anaconda follow the instructions in the following webpage:  
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-anaconda-on-ubuntu-18-04-quickstart

Create a conda environment for the PyBullet tutorial:  
```
$ conda create --name pyb_env  
```
Switch to the newly create environment (you will notice the name of the environment on the command line in the extreme left):  
```
$ conda activate pyb_env  
```

Once in the desired environment install the following packages:  
```
$ conda install nb_conda_kernels  
```

Install PyBullet (while in the environment):  
```
$ pip install pybullet  
```

Install Matplotlib (while in the environment):
```
$ conda install matplotlib
```



To check the installation launch:  
```
$ python  
```

Inside the python environment import the pybullet and matplotlib libraries:  
```
>> import pybullet
>> import matplotlib
```
If this command executes without any error then the installation is successful.  


Check the Jupyter notebook by running the following command in the bash shell:  
```
$ jupyter notebook  
```
This command will provide a URL. Run the URL in a browser (Firefox). If a web page opens up, then the Jupyter software is successfully installed.
